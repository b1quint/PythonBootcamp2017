# Python BootCamp 2017 @ IAG/USP, SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil

Here is the material that I produced to the Python BootCamp 2017 that 
happened at IAG/USP between Feb 13 and 17, 2017. I simply wanted to have the 
material that I uploaded to a personal repo so I could edit it without 
compromising others material.
